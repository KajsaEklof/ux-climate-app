It's burning and everywhere we see pictures of dying polar bears… Are you also starting to get frightened by recent climate change updates? And do you want to stop this negative trend?",
    "info2": "In this article, we will explain a few different concepts in climate change and give you tips on concrete changes you can make for a better climate yourself. Where to start, you wonder and when? Here and now, we say!",

    "heading": "Choose Wisely!",
    "info1": " Eating beef 1-2 times a week contributes to 604 kg of greenhouse gas emissions per year. That's more than four times as much as choosing chicken. And guess what, vegetarian options like beans have almost no climate impact at all! How about a varied, well thought out diet?",
    "info2": "...and what about wine? 3-5 glasses of wine per week gives half as much climate impact as the same amount of beer. In addition, wine has a lower climate impact than coffee. Skip the extra cup of coffee, and have a glass of wine on Friday! PS. Don't forget to choose organic.",

    "info1": "Clothes contain materials that require large resources to produce. They have gone through several manufacturing steps and often crossed several countries. The cotton in a t-shirt, for example, may have been grown in India, the fabric is knit in Pakistan, dyed in Bangladesh and sewn up in Turkey before finally reaching the store in England.",
    "info2": "…and on top of that, 2700 liters of water are needed to make one cotton shirt. So next time you might consider buying your t-shirt second hand instead…",
